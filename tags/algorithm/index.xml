      <description>Introduction First, let us introduce Adam which is an important first-order gradient descent algorithm for updating the weights in neural network. A brief introduction in Chinese could be referred here.
The whole name of ADAM is &amp;ldquo;adaptive moment estimation&amp;rdquo;, which means it is a combination of adaptive learning rate and momentum estimation. In this article, we would discuss the theory and proof in the following paper:
Reference
In this article, we would discuss some proofs about the features of this algorithm.</description>

      <description>In this article, we would discuss the trick about training and testing phases for dictionary learning (sparse coding). The original work could be referred here. As extra reading materials, we suggest reading Convex Optimization for understanding how to apply Lagrangian method and Matrix Cookbook to refer some conclusions about how to calculate gradients for matrices.

      <description>Introduction In this article, we would introduce two SEG-2018 expanded abstracts. The first one is about a new learning algorithm for transient electromagnetic method (TEM) inversion, and the second one is about using deep learning to solve FWI. In the following parts, we would discuss about the problems of the two papers and analyze which parts are not well proved. The two papers are listed below.

      <description>Introduction In this article, we would discuss the non-negative constrained least length problem. Due to the limitation of time, we only discuss the simplified form of this problem. The solution of this problem is derived from applying non-negative least squares algorithm.
KT conditions Check here to see Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions in Wikipedia.
 To solve this problem, first we need to introduce the Kuhn-Tucker (KT) theorem (or KT conditons).</description>

      <description>This article is incomplete now. Due to the problem of comprehension, I decide not to continue to review this article. Maybe I would try to review it again in the future.
 Introduction In this topic, we are learning an article for studying the theory of the convergence for the neural network applied on inverse problem. To be specific, the related articles include

      <description>Introduction This is a series of inspection on stochastic methods. Traditionally, an optimization problem could be solved by gradient descent methods, greedy algorithm and stochastic methods. For example, Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is a gradient descent based methods. Another example is OMP which is used to find a local minimum of L0 penalized problem. Since the L0 norm is totally indifferentiable, we could not calculate its gradient. Therefore, such kind of problem is generally more difficult than those differentiable problems.</description>

      <description>Introduction Check here to see Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm in Wikipedia.
 Check this link and we could review the theory of Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA), which is used as an improvement compared to the plain first-order gradient descent method. In this short discussion, we would like to talk about how and why we could derive such a method. Then we would know that when we could use this method and when we could not.</description>
