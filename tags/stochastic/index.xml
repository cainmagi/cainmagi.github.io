      <description>Introduction This is a series of inspection on stochastic methods. Traditionally, an optimization problem could be solved by gradient descent methods, greedy algorithm and stochastic methods. For example, Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm is a gradient descent based methods. Another example is OMP which is used to find a local minimum of L0 penalized problem. Since the L0 norm is totally indifferentiable, we could not calculate its gradient. Therefore, such kind of problem is generally more difficult than those differentiable problems.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this article we would summarize some popular solutions for the inverse problem. To be specific, here we only discuss the methods of inverse problems. Although when introducing some algorithms, we may need to explain what problem they work on, the various topics about which problem we solve is not what we concentrate on in this article.
Generally the solutions could be divided into 2 parts: optimizing methods and stochastic approaches.</description>
