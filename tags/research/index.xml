      <description>Introduction In this article, we would introduce two SEG-2018 expanded abstracts. The first one is about a new learning algorithm for transient electromagnetic method (TEM) inversion, and the second one is about using deep learning to solve FWI. In the following parts, we would discuss about the problems of the two papers and analyze which parts are not well proved. The two papers are listed below.

      <description>This article is incomplete now. Due to the problem of comprehension, I decide not to continue to review this article. Maybe I would try to review it again in the future.
 Introduction In this topic, we are learning an article for studying the theory of the convergence for the neural network applied on inverse problem. To be specific, the related articles include

      <description>Introduction In this article we would summarize some popular solutions for the inverse problem. To be specific, here we only discuss the methods of inverse problems. Although when introducing some algorithms, we may need to explain what problem they work on, the various topics about which problem we solve is not what we concentrate on in this article.
Generally the solutions could be divided into 2 parts: optimizing methods and stochastic approaches.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this note, we would like to discuss about an interesting idea: how to implement the conventional optimization methods in deep-learning architecture? Actually we have introduced this idea in note20180720. Here let us give a brief about this idea.
A brief about inversion First, we need to learn how the traditional inversion works. This process could be generally described as such a process:
   The workflow of a traditional inversion         Suppose we have a known data $\mathbf{y}_0$, a forward model function $\mathcal{F}$ could transform a model $\mathbf{x}$ into data $\mathbf{y}$.</description>

      <description>Introduction Here we would like to discuss about the some papers using deep learning methods to enhance the performance of the traditional inverse problems. The application should be limited in analyzing the electromagnetic wave or acoustic signal. Some works just make the application of existing methods, some works propose fundamental theory and some works give us an inspiration of available architectures. According to the relevance, we would like to divide them into 3 groups.</description>

      <description>Introduction The baseline of this work is existing asynchronous SGD algorithms including Hogwild, SVRG and SAGA. The author summarize the work as
 General composite optimization problem:
\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \arg \min\limits_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^p} &amp; f(\mathbf{x}) + h(\mathbf{x}),\\[5pt] \mathrm{s.t.}~&amp;f(\mathbf{x}) := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(\mathbf{x}), \end{aligned} \end{equation}  where each $f_i$ is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient (i.e. L-smooth), and the averaging function is $\mu$-strongly convex. $h$ is convex but potentially non-smooth, and it could be decomposed block coordinate-wise as</description>

Reference
Theory This article discusses about how to build a neural network with order-invariant input set.
 Theorem 1: which function could be set invariant:  Such a function $f(\mathbb{X})$ need to be able to be decomposed as such a form: \begin{align} f(\mathbb{X}) = \rho(\sum\limits_{x \in \mathbb{X}} \phi(x)). \end{align} 
 Since the general form of the layer of neural network is $F(\mathbf{x},~\boldsymbol{\Theta}) = \sigma (\boldsymbol{\Theta}\mathbf{x})$, we could know that according to the above theorem, only when</description>
