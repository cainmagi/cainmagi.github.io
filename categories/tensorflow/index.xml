      <description>Introduction In this project, we combine a deep-learning architecture with a traditional electromagnetic (EM) forward model which is differentiable. Since the model is differentiable, we could enable the gradient back propagated from the model to the deep-learning network. The following figure could be used to describe this design.
   The whole architecture of the project         Suppose we have gotten a group of response samples (i.</description>

      <description>Introduction This project is for AGT (Advanced Geophysical Technology) and 2018 SEG (Society of Exploration Geophysicists) conference. We concentrate on the seismic raw data and use deep learning approaches to improve the performance in some special application.
Beat Tone Network The first application is for improving the FWI of Beat Tone, see here to learn the background of this application:
Reference
When the basic signal frequency increases, the effectiveness of the Beat Tone method reduces significantly.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this project, we aim to process video stream by utilizing deep learning tools (tensorflow). The data is from the camera deployed beside the real shaker on well-logging site. When the shaker is spare, the surface of it is clean. However, during the well-logging process, the cuttings flow would come and get captured by the camera.
To build a complete system, we divde our work into two phases.</description>
