      <description>Introduction This is a series of inspection on stochastic methods. Traditionally, an optimization problem could be solved by gradient descent methods, greedy algorithm and stochastic methods. For example, Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm is a gradient descent based methods. Another example is OMP which is used to find a local minimum of L0 penalized problem. Since the L0 norm is totally indifferentiable, we could not calculate its gradient. Therefore, such kind of problem is generally more difficult than those differentiable problems.</description>

      <description>Introduction Check here to see Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm in Wikipedia.
 Check this link and we could review the theory of Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA), which is used as an improvement compared to the plain first-order gradient descent method. In this short discussion, we would like to talk about how and why we could derive such a method. Then we would know that when we could use this method and when we could not.</description>
